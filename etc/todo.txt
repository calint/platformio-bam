[ ] consider making one more layer of tile map for printing with transparency
    intended for "score", "game over" etc overlay over tiles and sprites
[ ] consider having several sprite sheets with sprite object containing sheet
    number
[ ] enum for sprite flip types: horizontal, vertical, both
[-] consider specifying which palette to use for a tile cell with the remaining
    4 bits in tile_map_flags. same per sprite. 16 palettes available
    => the tooling (gimp, tiled) are not easily adaptable for that
[ ] consider detecting collision between sprites and tile map
    => using 8-bits for collision map (limitation of esp32 largest chunk allocation)
       bit 8 flags if lower 7 bits is index in sprites or tiles
       reduces available sprites and tiles map to 127 in default configuration
       because 0xff is reserved for "empty"
[ ] change to specify only TOUCH_MIN/MAX_X/Y for default orientation and adjust
    read touch values in device source depending on application orientation vs
    default device screen orientation
[ ] #define O1STORE_DEBUG to check for double free, index out of bounds
[ ] JC4827W543R.hpp: what is the first init command 0xff,0xa5 ?
[ ] several sets of tiles cycled for animation
[ ] o1store: new_ list optimizing apply by putting new instances in deleted slots
    without swapping. if len(del_)>len(add_) no swaps will be made.
    concession is another list of size Size of pointers to instances
[ ] o1store: consider a minimal implementation of 'span' to return allocated list
[ ] vectorized functions:
    #include <esp32-hal-vector.h>
    float a[4] = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5};
    float b[4] = {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5};
    float result[4];
    vaddf(result, a, b, 4);
    => esp32 specific gain if used more extensively in game logic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] return false to free object after update, on_collision etc
[x] `application/objects/util/sprites_2x2`: utilize mirroring by specifying:
    0: no mirrors
    1: mirror all (e.g. circle, square)
    2: mirror horizontally (e.g. triangle)
    3: mirror vertically (e.g. oval)
[x] implement support for flipping tiles vertically and horizontally
    => Tiled supports flipping X and Y
    https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/global-tile-ids/#tile-flipping
       => in src/game/resources-from-tmx/parse-tmx.py
          extract lowest bits according to spec
          extract highest 4 bits as tile_map_flags.hpp
[x] JC4827W543C: "upload and monitor" is ok but when powering on, many times
    it does not boot in the same way causing the touch screen not to work and
    FPS is way down. Resetting using the board button does not fix the problem
    [ 31421][E][Wire.cpp:513] requestFrom(): i2cRead returned Error -1
    => needed to reset the i2c device to reliably work in cold boot
    => it still occasionally fails when resetting using the button
       => reset sequence before GT911 init in device file solved it
[x] move the constants in platform.ini to the device files
    => ESP32_2432S028R must be defined in platformio.ini because these are needed
       at compilation of TFT_eSPI
[x] animator.hpp: use sprite image indexes instead of pointers
[-] in JC4827W543C with multi-touch fire sometimes spawns more objects than
    available causing crash. increase maximum objects
    => 8-bit sprite collision map. more would require 16 bit
[x] use common file for JC4827W543 R/C by abstracting common behavior
[x] game_object: position relative to tile map or screen
    => sprite position adjusted in 'pre_render(...)'
[x] device.hpp: consider implementing sd_x and spiffs_x in the abstract class (DRY)
    => protected virtual init_sd_spiffs(...)
[x] ESP32_2432S028R.hpp: check why dma_n_scalines=64 is broken although pushPixels(...) ok
    => dma buffer swap when odd number of renders per screen
[-] o1store: ? inst_deleted->~object() at apply_free()
[x] render_scanline(...) consider looping through allocated sprites instead of all
[x] optimize sprite rendering from 'layers * sprites * O(scanlines)' to 'sprites * O(scanlines)'
    sprite *sprites_to_be_rendered[sprite_layers][sprites_count]
    sprite *sprites_to_be_rendered_end[sprite_layers]
    one pass through sprites to build the list
    => improved performance 46 FPS on JC... 100% DMA wait, no noticeable decrease in
       performance with added layers
[-] move sprite index from render_sprite struct to sprite saving:
    nlayers * nsprites * sizeof(sprite_ix) - nsprites * sizeof(sprite_ix) --- 510 B in 3 layers x 255 sprites
    => not considering padding and engine code which is platform independent vs main.cpp
       which is platform dependent and the render list is due to scanline by scanline rendering
[-] sprite layers as bit field. layer #1 0b001, #2 0b010, #3 0b100 etc
    bitwise comparison of layers between sprites at collision detection
    => does not work the collision map pixel is overwritten starting with layer 0 etc
[x] fix time rollover bug
    => dt would become huge so it is capped to 0.1 s
[x] investigate if chip revision is 0 indeed and PSRAM bug is possible
[x] investigate SPI_MAX_DMA_LEN which is 4092 but more seems to be possible without error
    => more than SPI_MAX_DMA_LEN can be transferred without error
       on JC4827W543R 32768 B
       on ESP32_2432S028R more than that but with rendering errors
[x] check sprite collisions between sprites that are in the same layer
[x] use object **const end = objects.store.allocated_list_end();
[x] o1store: Serial.printf
[x] flip sprite horizontal
[x] flip sprite vertical
[x] o1store: consider using std::vector instead of calloc and free
    => implementation is concise with some pointer shenanigans
[x] o1store: hang if overrun?
    => return nullptr
[x] o1store: can_allocate() is not thread safe
    => removed, use
      if (object *mem = objects.allocate_instance()) {
        bullet *blt = new (mem) bullet{};
[x] try n scanlines of display buffer and DMA transfer
    =>  1: 23 fps
    =>  2: 27 fps
    =>  4: 29 fps
    =>  8: 30 fps
    => 16: 31 fps
[x] examine generated assembler and compare 'for' and 'while'
[x] inspect the sign conversion warnings and consider converting size constants to signed
    => converted unsigned to signed including constants, sizes etc
[x] inspect conversion warnings
    => fixed with casts
[x] extract.sh width and height parameter
[x] fix rendering of 32x32 tiles and sprites
[x]   portrait
[x]   landscape
[x] render, render_scanline: improve handling of non evenly divisible width, height
[x] engine: make sprite_width, sprite_height, tile_width, tile_height user definable
    => size = 2^n  size 64 does not fit the DMA buffers in remaining ram
[x] o1store: consider replacing alloc_ix with pointer to array element
    removing array look-ups vs free_, alloc_, del_ would hold pointers (x4 space usage)
[x] consider locking dt to 30 fps for deterministic behavior
    => config in defs
[x] modifiable tiles map
[x] keep engine 'object' minimalistic and extract logic and update to 'game_object'
[x] display_width and height is defined in engine.hpp but is device dependent
    => extracted to 'platform.hpp' as platform dependent constant
[x] animated sprite class {sprite_img,ms}
    => animation implemented ad-hoc in 'game/objects/ship2.hpp'
[x] separate palette for sprites and tiles
[x] extract files into headers/source
[x] collision detection: bit field for type and collision interest
[-] o1store: consider std::array instead of pointers
    => done with pointer shenanigans
[x] o1store: consider using pointers instead indexes in arrays
[x] o1store: return pointer to object instead of reference.
    nullptr if allocation could not be done.
[x] sprite allocation for active objects
    => O(1) sprite allocation and free
[x] make sprite allocation class into a template
    => o1store
[x] objects composed of several sprites
[x] separate concept of sprite and object
[x] polymorphism without allocation on the heap
    => 'new' in place
[x] replace #define with constexpr
    => somewhat worse because it is unclear by naming what is constant
       consider reverting to 'defines' including other constexpr or naming captialized?
