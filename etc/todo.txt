[x] animator.hpp: use sprite image indexes instead of pointers
[ ] #define O1STORE_DEBUG to check for double free, index out of bounds
[ ] JC4827W543R.hpp: what is the first init command 0xff,0xa5 ?
[ ] several sets of tiles cycled for animation
[ ] o1store: new_ list optimizing apply by putting new instances in deleted slots
    without swapping. if len(del_)>len(add_) no swaps will be made.
    concession is another list of size Size of pointers to instances
[ ] o1store: consider a minimal implementation of 'span' to return allocated list
[ ] vectorized functions:
    #include <esp32-hal-vector.h>
    float a[4] = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5};
    float b[4] = {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5};
    float result[4];
    vaddf(result, a, b, 4);
    => esp32 specific gain if used more extensively in game logic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] game_object: position relative to tile map or screen
    => sprite position adjusted in 'pre_render(...)'
[x] device.hpp: consider implementing sd_x and spiffs_x in the abstract class (DRY)
    => protected virtual init_sd_spiffs(...)
[x] ESP32_2432S028R.hpp: check why dma_n_scalines=64 is broken although pushPixels(...) ok
    => dma buffer swap when odd number of renders per screen
[-] o1store: ? inst_deleted->~object() at apply_free()
[x] render_scanline(...) consider looping through allocated sprites instead of all
[x] optimize sprite rendering from 'layers * sprites * O(scanlines)' to 'sprites * O(scanlines)'
    sprite *sprites_to_be_rendered[sprite_layers][sprites_count]
    sprite *sprites_to_be_rendered_end[sprite_layers]
    one pass through sprites to build the list
    => improved performance 46 FPS on JC... 100% DMA wait, no noticeable decrease in
       performance with added layers
[-] move sprite index from render_sprite struct to sprite saving:
    nlayers * nsprites * sizeof(sprite_ix) - nsprites * sizeof(sprite_ix) --- 510 B in 3 layers x 255 sprites
    => not considering padding and engine code which is platform independent vs main.cpp
       which is platform dependent and the render list is due to scanline by scanline rendering
[-] sprite layers as bit field. layer #1 0b001, #2 0b010, #3 0b100 etc
    bitwise comparison of layers between sprites at collision detection
    => does not work the collision map pixel is overwritten starting with layer 0 etc
[x] fix time rollover bug
    => dt would become huge so it is capped to 0.1 s
[x] investigate if chip revision is 0 indeed and PSRAM bug is possible
[x] investigate SPI_MAX_DMA_LEN which is 4092 but more seems to be possible without error
    => more than SPI_MAX_DMA_LEN can be transferred without error
       on JC4827W543R 32768 B
       on ESP32_2432S028R more than that but with rendering errors
[x] check sprite collisions between sprites that are in the same layer
[x] use object **const end = objects.store.allocated_list_end();
[x] o1store: Serial.printf
[x] flip sprite horizontal
[x] flip sprite vertical
[x] o1store: consider using std::vector instead of calloc and free
    => implementation is concise with some pointer shenanigans
[x] o1store: hang if overrun?
    => return nullptr
[x] o1store: can_allocate() is not thread safe
    => removed, use
      if (object *mem = objects.allocate_instance()) {
        bullet *blt = new (mem) bullet{};
[x] try n scanlines of display buffer and DMA transfer
    =>  1: 23 fps
    =>  2: 27 fps
    =>  4: 29 fps
    =>  8: 30 fps
    => 16: 31 fps
[x] examine generated assembler and compare 'for' and 'while'
[x] inspect the sign conversion warnings and consider converting size constants to signed
    => converted unsigned to signed including constants, sizes etc
[x] inspect conversion warnings
    => fixed with casts
[x] extract.sh width and height parameter
[x] fix rendering of 32x32 tiles and sprites
[x]   portrait
[x]   landscape
[x] render, render_scanline: improve handling of non evenly divisible width, height
[x] engine: make sprite_width, sprite_height, tile_width, tile_height user definable
    => size = 2^n  size 64 does not fit the DMA buffers in remaining ram
[x] o1store: consider replacing alloc_ix with pointer to array element
    removing array look-ups vs free_, alloc_, del_ would hold pointers (x4 space usage)
[x] consider locking dt to 30 fps for deterministic behavior
    => config in defs
[x] modifiable tiles map
[x] keep engine 'object' minimalistic and extract logic and update to 'game_object'
[x] display_width and height is defined in engine.hpp but is device dependent
    => extracted to 'platform.hpp' as platform dependent constant
[x] animated sprite class {sprite_img,ms}
    => animation implemented ad-hoc in 'game/objects/ship2.hpp'
[x] separate palette for sprites and tiles
[x] extract files into headers/source
[x] collision detection: bit field for type and collision interest
[-] o1store: consider std::array instead of pointers
    => done with pointer shenanigans
[x] o1store: consider using pointers instead indexes in arrays
[x] o1store: return pointer to object instead of reference.
    nullptr if allocation could not be done.
[x] sprite allocation for active objects
    => O(1) sprite allocation and free
[x] make sprite allocation class into a template
    => o1store
[x] objects composed of several sprites
[x] separate concept of sprite and object
[x] polymorphism without allocation on the heap
    => 'new' in place
[x] replace #define with constexpr
    => somewhat worse because it is unclear by naming what is constant
       consider reverting to 'defines' including other constexpr or naming captialized?
